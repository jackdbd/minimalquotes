Describe your feature request with a [user story](https://www.visual-paradigm.com/guide/agile-software-development/what-is-user-story/). Use the following template:

> As a {role}, I want to {action}, so that {benefit}

`role` is the **who** of this story. It must be one of:

`benefit` is **why** you want to do it, the goal you want to achieve.

*Example*:

> As an authenticated user, I want to navigate to my profile page, so that I can see my stats.
